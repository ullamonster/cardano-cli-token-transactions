# token transactions for Cardano using cardano-cli

No guarantees this will work for you, use at your own risk!

Assumptions/Prereq's

- $NODE_HOME = base folder where your scripts are run on your node
- have a logs folder structure within $NODE_HOME called 'logs' containing 'payments' and 'sent'
- sign transactions on another "cold" system (can still be done on the node, just put the cold scripts on the node in that case)
- have a logs folder structure within your "cold" system called 'logs'
